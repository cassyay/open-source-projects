### Food-101 Project <br>
Code and description are in the food-101 folder. <br>

**Summary** <br>
The MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets offer a good very first introduction to building a CNN to classify images. But, they are not good as an introduction to many steps of deep learning that are an integral part of every machine learner’s understanding--data preparation, augmentation, feature engineering, pre-trained models, etc. Additionally, they are not so relevant to people’s lives, or offer a good example of cutting-edge AI. A dataset that requires data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, training, and testing, as well as show the potentiality of deep learning, should be introduced in foundational teaching. The Food-101 dataset offers the opportunity to work with a real-world dataset -- messy data, diverse imagery, etc. The dataset is organized similarly to how data is often encountered in real world scenarios. <br>
